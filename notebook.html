												<p>Rules of my life:</p>
												<ol>
													<li>In any situation, there are always 3 ways for action. Neither 1 nor 2, but 3. Heads, tails or edge.</li>
													<li>You should always help people. The time will come and you'll be in need for help too.</li>
													<li>Always leave tips to persons for their work. Don't leave without rewarding someone with tips who has worked for it.</li>
												</ol>
											</div><!-- Visible Note Text -->
											<div class="hidden">
												<ol class="lists">
													<li>Drink more water.</li>
													<li>Life isn't a fairytale. The sooner you understand this - the easier you accept it.</li>
													<li>Wake up early. At 6:00 am. Be a nightingale.</li>
													<li>Plan your day. Make a plan for the nearest future. I mean days, week, month and year. Set goals and just do it.</li>
													<li>Read more. Develop your speech and your imagination. You must train your brain.</li>
													<li>Do sport every day. Surely, accompanieda by music.</li>
													<li>Clean your room. If you know how to make a mess, you must know how to clean it up. If you can't put things in order, how would you manage doing this with your life?</li>
													<li>Find a job you would like best. I mean your ideal job, a job that delights you. And remember, the best job is your hobby. Do what you love, love what you do and let it bring pleasure</li>
													<li>Don't listen to anyone. Do what you consider worth doing. Enjoy it, because this life is yours.</li>
													<li>If everyone drinks tea without sugar and you like sweet tea, add more sugar. Taste the life sweet.</li>
													<li>Be of your own view. Don't choose a convenient truth.</li>
													<li>If "Plan A" didn't work, you still have 26 letters. If they say that your train is gone, just remember you have besides an airplane , a helicopter, a car or even a bicycle. Remember when you were a baby and learned to walk. Your attempts had little success. You didn't give it up saying "This is not for me". Don't betray your dreams.</li>
													<li>Travel as much as possible. You have to see the whole world. Why did someone see the Eiffel Tower, and you didn't? Why someone walked on the " Great Wall of China " but not you? We are often told to save money. But I think if you are not 40 years old this is all a bullshit. Invest in yourself. Spend all money on travel and buy clothes abroad. After all what difference does it make, how old your sneakers are, if you you are wearing them while walking in California?</li>
													<li>Never insult a person. No one knows what is in her heart and how she treats you.</li>
													<li>Before saying something think about your idea. Think twice.</li>
													<li>Take risks every day. Risk- is a life. If you don't take risk, you'll not win. The biggest risk -is to never risk anything in your life. Once you risk, you can win everything, but if you don't risk, you will lose 100%.</li>
													<li>Don't BE afraid of changes. Do something new. Can you remember me, the last time you did something new?</li>
													<li>Dream.</li>
													<li>Be a gentlemen in any situation</li>
													<li>Give your girlfriend chocolate. Any girl is likeas a child, and every child likesloves sweets. Winning the girl`s heart is not so difficult. You need TO BE able to do three things: to pity her, to pamper and to make her smile.</li>
													<li>Don't make promises if you know you can't keep THEM.</li>
													<li>Never stop smiling, what if someone is looking at you right at the moment? Then he falls in love with your smile. He will remember you happy, not sad. Hmm someone might be taking A picture of you, then you have to keep your back erectly!</li>
													<li>Create new ideas, what if you are someone who will change this world? WHAT IF you are the one who will change "History" or write new stories . Or tear the hooks of stereotypes? And if they tell you are crazy, say them that you are a genius.</li>
													<li>Be smart, but don't try to be clever. Fool around, but don't be a fool.</li>
													<li>If you like a person, then what difference does it make how much money she has? Or what color is her skin?</li>
													<li>After all remember that there are no rules. Never get bogged <br />Down under the law and the government. Free people build everything for themselves, only god can judge you. If you want to do something, just do it. And don't pay attention what they say to you.</li>
													<li>Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching.</li>

											<div class="text-justify">Dream... What does it mean? What is dream like? What should it be about?
 											What is your dream? I think everyone has a dream. I have it too. And I will tell you about it. You know, every morning I wake up at 6 o'clock and I'm doubted : " May be no? Is it wrong? If it doesn't work? Why I do that? May I will go to sleep for a little bit more?". And every time I find strength to say:" No, I'm getting up right now, I need it, and I can do this despite everything." After all, if I give up, it won't get better.</div><!-- Visible Note Text -->

											<div class="hidden text-justify">The first rule of the dream: " Never change your dream". Dreams of everyone aren't same: children, teenagers, adults and old people have them different. In my childhood , I dreamed of becoming an astronaut and exploring the serenity of space, outside, galaxy. Of making new discoveries for the whole humanity. Then I wanted to become a doctor and to save people's lives, find medicines for cancer, AIDS, Wil...That people could be cured and would have never got sick again. I wanted to become a policeman, to save the world from crime and villains. I even wanted to be a fireman, so not to allow fire destroy and take people's lives. If I was a fireman, I would have extinguished the whole hell for sure. Beside all of that - I still want to become a hero. Time is running, running so fast... Now I'm 19 years old. I will graduate my university in 3 years. But I have no idea who I will become. How do I see myself in, say, 10 years? Then to connect my life? Where to go? There is a dream, but how will those opportunities get through it? Most students don't think about these things. They just don't try to think about it. Your dream may die if you refuse to think. Now can you assure me in succeeding of getting a job of your dream? I mean you  can just waste your time for college and university and finally get job which you will not like. And you know why? Because in 20 years you won't have a brain. Even if you get a well-paid job, but the one which won't bring you any joy. What will you do after? What is the price for this mistake? That's your being a fool. If you are not doing what you love, you are just wasting time. Do you think  they are waiting for you? Nobody is waiting for you, but you have to fight for your dream. Come on, show your character. Be strong. One of my friends said to me something I think I will never be able to forget , she said "The wind is rising! We must try to live". The main problem of the mankind is that we are looking for reasons, justifications and think too late. After all, you need to change something, to move somewhere, to do something what you believe in. Is it better to live like this or to open the new opportunities?
											The second rule of the dream: " Purpose & Perseverance". Fall in sleep with a dream, wake up with a goal. Take off all stuff what prevents you from dreaming. Make a plan and follow it, creat a goal and just do it. Who if not you? When if not now? Where if not here?
											Dear friend, I really believe in you. I know you can do it, just find your way. Try to change this world. Anyway, people live in two worlds, what is happening right now is a "Real world" and what you expect from the world is "Unreal world". In which of them do you live? If you live in "Real world" put yourself on 100% to make this world better. And if it doesn't work, but you tried, you did everything you could and I appreciate it. Do you understand what I mean? One man can't change the world, but he can give direction. Let's change the world together. Rewrite History. Loud mind. The future is unwritten. Remember that and do something good for everyone.
											Children are taught from childhood to talk and think negatively. " Kid, you must to be a programmer, engineer or logistician, because it's promising. Good company, a lot of money and other stuff. " But if I don't like it, what about my dream? I was thrown into the aquarium like a live trapped fish. My choice was stolen. And if I am like a fish I want to get into the big sea, open my new ocean. I want to change " The book of History " It all depends on you, only you who decide what will happen tomorrow with your life. Not parents, not teacher, not a state. Have your opinion, do not be scary, defend your opinion. Do not choose a convenient truth, do not let someone tell you what you have  to do. " Live the full time, Thoughts are free".
											I remember when my younger brother was in the kindergarten, one day I came to meet him. There was a teacher who asked every child who they wanted to become when they grew up. All children answered differently, someone said that he wanted to be a millionaire, another chooses a model career, apart of that you could hear the answers like a president, a doctor, a superman and many others. And only one boy said: " I want to be Happy as Jim Carrey " The teacher said: " I think you didn't understand the question!" . " Nope, It seems like you didn't understand the answer " was what I said. And a little boy who wanted to be happy like Jim Carrey, he was my brother. That's Funny, because when I was a little boy in the kindergarten and my teacher asked me the same thing, I said that I want to be the best friend of Jim Carrey . Why? That's simple , because the man in 30, 40 and 50 years fools around, gives smiles to people and shares happiness with everyone . My hero is Jim Carrey. Nobody understood me, but the main thing is that you understand yourself. I think you understand what my dream is. My dream is to make discovery for the whole of humanity, to move in the right direction, to teach, to give something new and useful for this planet that I would be remembered for, not just by the waiter from the restaurant or builder of water tank, but to be someone more than just Di...I want to be a hope.
											The third rule of a dream: " Go and take your own, that by right belongs to you!"
											And what if I told you once risking for the sake of a dream, you can lose everything and there is nothing to be left for. But if you win, you will have everything. It's up to you. That's your choice and your life . This is like Eminem's song "Lose yourself "

											"... Look, If you had
											One shot or one opportunity
											To seize everything you ever wanted
											In one moment
											Would you capture
											Or just let it slip..."</div><!-- Hidden Note Text -->
